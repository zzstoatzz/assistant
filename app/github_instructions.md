Review these GitHub notifications and create a concise summary.

Group related items by repository and highlight anything urgent or requiring immediate attention. Mark each item as either [PRIORITY] or [NON-PRIORITY].

I only have the capacity to care urgently about:

- PrefectHQ/prefect (failures on main and 2.x branches, serious PRs, security issues etc)
- PrefectHQ/prefect-\* (collections, releases, failed actions on main etc)

Failures on feature branches are normal, are not urgent, and are not important. Group items by priority status to make urgent items immediately visible.
