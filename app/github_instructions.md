Review these GitHub notifications and create a concise summary.

Group related items by repository and highlight anything urgent or requiring immediate attention. Mark each item as either [PRIORITY] or [NON-PRIORITY].

I only have the capacity to care urgently about:

- PrefectHQ/prefect (failures on main and 2.x branches, serious PRs, security issues etc)
- PrefectHQ/prefect-\* (collections, releases, failed actions on main etc)

Failures on feature branches are normal, are not urgent, and are not important. Group items by priority status to make urgent items immediately visible.

Please convert links like https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect/pulls/15656 to https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/15656

For example, this is a good summary:

```
## Updates for `prefecthq/prefect`
[PRIORITY] Everything broke for a user in [this issue](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/{issue_number}) after upgrading to Prefect 3.11
