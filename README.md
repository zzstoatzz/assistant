# Assistant

## Quick Start

See `app/README.md` for detailed setup, or run:

```bash
make setup  # Setup environment
make dev    # Development with hot reload
make        # Build and run in container
make clean  # Cleanup
```

An AI-powered service that observes information streams (email, GitHub, Slack) and maintains a compressed historical record, focusing on what's important while preserving context.

## How It Works

Events flow through three stages:

1. **Raw Observations**: New events from various sources are collected and summarized
2. **Compression**: Related events are grouped and compressed over time
3. **Archive**: Historical context is preserved with links to source materials

```python
# Example: How information flows through the system
ObservationSummary(
    timestamp=now,
    summary="PR #123 needs review",
    source_types=["github", "slack"]
)
â†“
CompactedSummary(
    start_time=window_start,
    end_time=window_end,
    summary="Core API redesign in [RFC-123](url)",
    key_points=["Database migration planned"],
    importance_score=0.9
)
```

## Project Structure
